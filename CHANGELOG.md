# Changelog

All notable changes to the PetChain-Contracts project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Storage-rent and cleanup observability: read-only `get_storage_metrics` reports per-pet quota usage, configured cap, remaining headroom and the soft-deleted medical-record cleanup backlog (counts only, no medical content), scanned in bounded, resumable pages
- Cross-contract interface compatibility tests: CI deploys the main, ownership/adoption/escrow and vet-registry contracts into one local Soroban environment and checks shared authorization, errors, events and state transitions, with a fixture that fails on signature or enum drift (`stellar-contracts/docs/cross-contract-compat.md`)
- Pull request template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) to standardize contributor submissions
- Canonical chain-of-custody digest (`get_custody_chain_digest`) so consumers can prove a returned custody history is complete and ordered: SHA-256 hash chain over domain, version, pet ID, sequence, and every entry in canonical order, with published test vectors and tamper cases
- Repaired pre-existing `stellar-contracts` build breakage (the crate did not compile at `main`): removed a duplicated `MAX_PREREQUISITES` const and duplicated `ContractError` variants, restored `ProposalNotFound = 47` and `StaleMigration = 169`, added the missing `TrainingMilestone::prerequisites` field, fixed ~20 `safe_increment` call sites, and refreshed the stale ABI snapshot

### Changed / Migration notes (certificates, vet credentials, duration safety, idempotency)

- `CertificateAnchor` is now paired with a separate `CertificateLifecycle` record
  (`cert_id`, `issue_time`, `expiry`, `revoked`, `revoked_at`,
  `revocation_reason`). The change is storage-additive — existing anchors are
  still readable. Operators should re-anchor certificates whose cert_id / expiry
  / revocation tracking is required. `verify_certificate` now returns `false`
  for expired or revoked certificates. Run `migrate_storage` to v3.0.0 to record
  the schema bump.

- Vet credentials now support an optional expiry (`VetCredentialsExpiry`
  storage key). `verify_vet` continues to produce a perpetual (no-expiry) vet;
  use `verify_vet_with_expiry` to bind an expiry. `is_verified_vet` now rejects
  vets whose credentials have expired. All privileged medical operations that
  previously gated on vet verification (`add_vaccination`, `add_medical_record`,
  `anchor_certificate`) now enforce credential validity.

- `get_upcoming_vaccinations` and groomer-slot overlap checks use saturating
  duration arithmetic to prevent ledger-timestamp panics near `u64::MAX`.

- `anchor_certificate_idempotent` provides replay-safe certificate anchoring:
  re-submitting the same `(pet_id, vaccination_id, cert_hash)` returns the
  existing `cert_id`; a conflicting hash raises `CertificateHashConflict`.

- New errors: `CertificateNotFound` (47), `CertificateRevoked` (48),
  `CertificateExpired` (49), `VetCredentialsExpired` (50),
  `CertificateHashConflict` (51).

- Vet registration and verification system
- Vet information storage and retrieval

#### Behavior & Nutrition Tracking

- Pet behavior logging and history
- Nutrition tracking and records management

#### Data & Storage

- IPFS integration for off-chain data storage
- Attachment support for linking external files
- Efficient on-chain storage patterns with optimized data structures
- Statistics aggregation for pet data insights

#### Governance & Upgrades

- Upgrade proposal system for contract improvements
- Admin initialization and management

#### Backend Services

- Configurable TOTP-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Cryptographic agility (SHA1/SHA256/SHA512, 6/8 digits, custom periods)
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- 8 backup codes generation with recovery mechanism
- Rate limiting support
- Database schema for 2FA data persistence

#### Testing

#### CI/CD & Tooling

- `.gitignore` configured for Rust/Stellar project

### Changed

#### Gas Optimization

- Storage pattern optimization: single storage instance reused across operations, batched storage writes
- Loop optimization for vaccination history functions (40-60% gas reduction)
- Access control function inlining (25-30% reduction)
- Vector pre-allocation for known sizes
- Timestamp and storage instance caching
- **Overall average gas savings: 30-40%** across all operations

### Fixed

- **Critical cryptographic vulnerability**: Fixed fixed-nonce encryption in `encrypt_sensitive_data` that enabled replay attacks, dictionary attacks, and information leakage. Now uses ledger timestamp + persistent counter for unique 12-byte nonces.
- Input limit validations for public functions
- Proper error handling for invalid pet IDs and missing records

- Replaced static all-zero encryption key with runtime-derived key material
- Added authorization checks for all state-changing functions
- Rate limiting for 2FA endpoints
- Secure backup code generation and invalidation after use
- HTTPS enforcement recommendations for backend services
